Figure 1: (a) Representation of the ferromagnetic domain wall-carrying ‘control’ nanowire and ‘bit’ nanoisland, separated by a non-magnetic gap of height h. (b)–(d) Time-evolution series of the magnetic reversal process in two-nanoisland system. Both nanoislands are initially magnetized with 𝑀=−𝑦̂  (b) before the current-driven ‘control’ domain wall (c-DW) traverses the right-hand nanoisland, inducing magnetization reversal (c), leaving it magnetized 𝑀=+𝑦̂, whereas the left-hand nanoisland remains unswitched (d). It is noteworthy that the internal domain wall structure in (c) and (d) is slightly distorted by the drive-current; (b) shows the static, relaxed domain wall state. (e) Detailed time-evolution series of the reversal process in a single 400 × 75 × 5 nm3 nanoisland. The dynamic c-DW is represented by the white circle traversing the nanoisland midpoint, moving with 𝑣c−DW=+𝑥̂. t = 0 s is defined when the c-DW begins moving from its origin, 112 nm to the nanoisland’s left. The partially formed contorted nanoisland domain wall is highlighted in t = 0.6 ns by the dashed grey line, with the partially formed straight island domain wall highlighted by longer grey dashes in t = 0.65 ns. Topological defects are labelled with their winding numbers.
